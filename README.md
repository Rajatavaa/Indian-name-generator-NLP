# Name Generator(MLP)

This project is inspired from Andrej's Makemore(Bigram model) where i trained a simple feed forward neural network on a dataset containing Indian names.
After training the model it generates baby name ideas that all sound name-like, but are not already existing names and not only human names we can generate anything like company names,pet names etc.

# Preprocessing 

Preprocessed the data to remove any unwanted characters other than english alphabets,removed blank spaces,duplicate entries etc.
